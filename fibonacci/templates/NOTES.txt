To see this service in the the dashboard you will need to add the following environmental variables for the catalog service.  In Openshift these can be added in the Applications> Deployment > Catalog > Environment Tab. 
Increment <N> so if the last service defined in catalog's environment variables is 7 then replace <N> with 8. 


| Parameter                                                 | Description                | Example                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| catalog.services.service_<N>.capability                   | Service Capability         | 'Grey Matter'                      |
| catalog.services.service_<N>.documentation                | Service Documentation Path | ''                                 |
| catalog.services.service_<N>.name                         | Service Name               | 'Grey Matter <Service_Name>'       |
| catalog.services.service_<N>.owner                        | Service Owner              | 'Decipher'                         |
| catalog.services.service_<N>.version                      | Service Version            | "0.1.2"                            |
| catalog.services.service_<N>.zookeeper_announcement_point | Service ZK announce point  | "/services/catalog/0.1.2/metrics"  |

Once these environmental variables are added catalog will need to restart for the effects to take effect.
